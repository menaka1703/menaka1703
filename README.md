## 🚀 Projects

### 🤖 Smart AI Interview System for Recruitment & Skill Assessment

I created the **Smart Interview System**, a web platform that uses AI to make hiring **faster**, **fairer**, and **more efficient**. It automates three major interview types:

1. Aptitude Tests  
2. Q&A Interviews  
3. HR Interviews (automated or live)
- 🧠 **Aptitude Test:** Scored spoken answers with TF-IDF.
- 💬 **Q&A Interviews:** Sentence Transformers select job-relevant questions, LLaMA 2 generates QA pairs, and TF-IDF scores responses.
- 👤 **HR Interview:** LLaMA 3.2 evaluates open-ended answers on clarity and relevance.
- 🎯 **Monitoring:** YOLOv5 ensures one person; Faster R-CNN detects mobile phones. 3 violations auto-end the interview.
- 🗣️ **Speech Recognition:** Google Web Speech API converts voice to text.
- 📊 **Admin Dashboard:** Displays scores, trends, and reports.

**Tech Used:** FastAPI, Bootstrap, YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, TF-IDF, LLaMA 2/3.2, Sentence Transformers, Google Web Speech API  

### 📄 Multimodal PDF Q&A Chatbot using OCR and Local LLM

Built an interactive PDF QA system that understands both text and images from uploaded documents.

- 🖼️ **Image-to-Text:** Used Tesseract OCR + PyMuPDF to extract text from images.
- 🧠 **Semantic Retrieval:** LangChain + HuggingFace embeddings (MiniLM-L6-v2), stored in FAISS.
- 🔍 **Smart Answering:** Enhanced relevance using Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR).
- 🤖 **LLM Response Generation:** Queried local LLaMA2 model (via Ollama) with custom prompts.
- 💻 **User Interface:** Deployed using Streamlit for real-time uploads and chat-style querying.

**Tech Used:** Tesseract OCR, PyMuPDF, LangChain, FAISS, HuggingFace, LLaMA2 (Ollama), Streamlit

### 📄 A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR CYBERDEFENSE THROUGH AI-ENABLED MALWARE AND INTRUSION DETECTION

- 🩺 **Models:** Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras), and stacking ensembles (SL1: DL meta-learner, SL2: XGBoost meta-learner) for       detecting intrusions and malware.
- 🧹 **Preprocessing:** Label encoding for categorical data, StandardScaler for feature normalization, and handling missing values to prepare network, Android           (Drebin), and IoT datasets.
- 🎯 **Feature Selection:** Processes high-dimensional datasets (42 features for network, 216 for Drebin, 63 for IoT) to extract relevant features for efficient         model training.
- 🔧 **Tuning:** Optimizes models with configurations like XGBoost (logloss, random_state=42) and SVM (probability=True) for improved accuracy and robustness.

**Tech Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, XGBoost, Matplotlib for visualization, and Jupyter Notebooks for development and experimentation.

### 🛡️ Seatbelt Detection System with Vision Transformer

AI-powered system to detect seatbelt usage from roadside camera images for improved traffic safety.

- 🧠 **Model:** Fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with custom fully connected layers.
- 🖼️ **Preprocessing:** Image resizing, augmentation, normalization, and dropout.
- 🛠️ **Training:** Trained with AdamW optimizer, early stopping over 50 epochs.
- 📉 **Challenge Solved:** Reduced overfitting while achieving high accuracy.
- 🚗 **Impact:** Helps enforce seatbelt use via automated camera analysis.

**Tech Used:** Vision Transformer (ViT), PyTorch, AdamW, Data Augmentation, Early Stopping
